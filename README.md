# dsm_testing

This is a quick and dirty (read: highly experimental) [Synthesis](https://mutagen-modding.github.io/Synthesis/) 
patcher which I hope will be useful for analyzing and _maybe_ creating patches for the [DarkStar Manufacturing](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/9963) Starfield mod.

Massive props to everybody on the DarkStar (especially WykkydGaming and DaAngryMechanic) and Synthesis (especially Noggog) Discord servers for their help.
